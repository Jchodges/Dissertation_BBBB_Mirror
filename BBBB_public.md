## 4. CHAPTER SUMMARIES

### 4.1 Chapter 1 – Piciformes Brain
### Chapter 1 – Piciformes Brain: Session Summary (Project Hygiene + Results Draft)
(From session: Project hygiene & canonical Methods/Results alignment)

**Work done**
- Cleaned project file architecture.
- Established GPT mode strategy (Pro / Deep Research / Extended / Regular).
- Canonicalized Methods: sampling, trait assembly, PGLS pipelines, model grids, diagnostics, GLS, influence checks, LOO CV, BM/OU/EB.
- Drafted qualitative Results that reflect the Methods (no numbers yet).

**Key decisions**
- Treat absolute vs relative brain size as parallel but unequal analytical tiers.
- Causal inference must be explicitly cautious; avoid mechanism claims without diagnostics + LOO support.
- Tables are authoritative numeric containers; inline numbers allowed but secondary.

**Open questions**
- Strengthening causal framing in Results/Discussion.
- Determining placement of numeric results (tables + inline).
- Integrating BM/OU/EB results into the Discussion.

**Next actions**
- Export numeric model summaries from R.
- Build tables for all major analyses.
- Revise Results to emphasize associational framing and limits on causal inference.
### Chapter 1 – Piciformes Brain: Session Summary (Data Sources + Finalized Methods)

**Work done**
- Locked down and documented brain data sources across Garcia-Peña, Iwaniuk datasets, Sayol, Corfield, Ksepka, Ferreira, Fedorova, Cardenas-Posada, Oyston, Fristoe, Hodges CT data.
- Established Average_BrainVolume_mL derivation pipeline.
- Canonicalized Mass_canonical (AVONET BodyMass-Value).
- Canonicalized wing trait sources (AVONET + HWA).
- Canonicalized Diet_5Cat, dropping only n=1 categories.
- Finalized MCC Jetz/BirdTree phylogeny usage.

**Methods section fully drafted with these subsections**
- Study system & sampling  
- Trait data assembly  
- Phylogenetic data processing  
- Trait preprocessing (PGLS mass correction)  
- Absolute & relative PGLS models  
- Systematic model grids  
- Diagnostics  
- Heteroscedastic GLS  
- Influence analysis  
- LOO PGLS  
- BM/OU/EB process models  
- Reproducibility & data pipeline

**Open tasks**
- Create metadata file linking trait columns → data sources → citation.
- Finalize bibliographic references.
- Double-check BM/OU/EB code paths.
- Decide metadata file placement in dissertation/mss.

**Defaults established**
- Mass = AVONET BodyMass-Value.
- Diet = EltonTraits → Diet_5Cat (drop only n=1).
- Brain_rel_PGLS = PGLS residuals.
- MCC Jetz/BirdTree Hackett phylogeny = sole tree unless overridden.

## 7. NEXT ACTIONS
These must always match the mirror’s `/tasks/` folder.

- See: `/tasks/log_2025.md`

## 8. Teaching Project – BIOL 4161 TA Standardization & Cardiac Treatment Database

### Session Summary
**Work done**
- Ingested Physio.zip, parsed course structure.
- Identified core buckets: course docs, system-specific rubrics, cardiac final project materials, neural readings, graded examples.
- Ingested six neuro-relevant PDFs.
- Built canonical neurophysiology framework (membrane potential, APs, synapses, reflexes, ANS).
- Identified core vocabulary for TA consistency.

**Key decisions**
- TA docs will use standardized neural physiology language from course PDFs + your uploads.
- The cardiac treatment database will be part of the unified project, not separate.

**Open questions**
- First deliverable: glossary vs lab-specific neural guide?
- Cross-system template structure for TA docs.
- Database schema for cardiac treatments.

**Next actions**
1. Choose glossary-first vs neural-lab-guide-first.
2. Draft cross-system TA document template.
3. Outline cardiac treatment database schema.
